# Go Microservice

A microservice is the concept of taking grouped functionalities, and separating those concerns into their own, independent runnable codebase.

Microservices are supported by just about all languages, after all, microservices are a concept rather than a specific framework or tool. That being said, some languages are better suited and, or have better support for microservices than others. One language with great support is Golang.
